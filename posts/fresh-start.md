Vaguely reflecting on my new personal website.

--

I've always enjoyed running a personal website - having a centralized place to display my projects and stuff. I have run it since I started coding, at around 14 or so. Never did analytics on it, for all I know, no one has ever seen it. But I enjoy it, so, here we are.

My latest iteration of it was in early 2022, when I decided to port it to Next.JS, just to be one of the React cool kids with the build step and the deployments and whatever. I was also focused in frontend development and wanted to present myself as such.

Finding myself delusioned with the state of modern frontend development, and given that my current professional position is largely on the server side, I have decided to rewrite my personal site in a much simpler stack. PHP for the server logic, and HTMX for presentation.

That's all there is to it really. A less fancy website that I feel much more comfortable calling mine. Because I truly understand how and why it all works, from the point the http request is sent, to the point it shows up on someone's screen. I could not understand how a React site works step-by-step in a million years.
